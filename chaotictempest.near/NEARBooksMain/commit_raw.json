The more books you add, the more they will get indexed onto the NEAR Chain, effectively migrating all book info onto the decentralized network eventually.\n\n## Feed\n\nThe feed will show you all the activity happening from who you are following. This will act like a timeline of sorts comparatively to other sorts of social networks.\n\n\n## Search\n\nSearch for books and add them to your collection. The added books will trigger a transaction call to add the book to the NEAR chain. This will only happen if the booked hasn't been indexed yet.\n\n\n## Future\n\nThis is not the end all state of this sort of application. This can be applied not only to books but other sources of interests like movies or comics.", "metadata.image.ipfs_cid": "bafkreidaeli2mxxnphqua2zbiwhfklv4vtpxsmyzjzf5pvo7pr32wz3atu", "metadata.name": "NEAR Books", "metadata.tags.books": "", "metadata.tags.social": "", "metadata.tags.app": NaN, "metadata.tags.activity": NaN, "metadata.tags.interests": NaN}
