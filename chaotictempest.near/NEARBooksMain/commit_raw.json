This application effectively allows for a online database for books.\n\n## Feed\n\nThe feed acts like a timeline in comparison to other social networks, where our who we follow's activity shows up here.\n\n## Search\n\nSearch for books and add them our collection. The more we search, the more gets tracked in our decentralized book database backed on the NEAR blockchain.\n\n## Future\n\nThis is intended to be an example use case of recommending interests and keeping up with what people are doing. Other points of interests such as movies or comics can also be done, but books is a good starting point to showcase what's possible, and how we can migrate large amounts of data over to NEAR.", "metadata.image.ipfs_cid": "bafkreidaeli2mxxnphqua2zbiwhfklv4vtpxsmyzjzf5pvo7pr32wz3atu", "metadata.name": "NEAR Books", "metadata.tags.books": "", "metadata.tags.social": "", "metadata.tags.app": NaN, "metadata.tags.activity": "", "metadata.tags.interests": ""}
