    <h4>
      <strong>How do I find projects?</strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
      You can search all current projects on the NEAR Horizon Application page
    </p>

    <br />
    <br />
    <h4>
      <strong>Are there analytics?</strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
      Yes! The main application page will display ecosystem stats from{" "}
      <a href="https://nearatlas.com/#/">Atlas</a>. We also use{" "}
      <a href="https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/azerbaijan/near-horizon-activity-vSci5p">

      </a>{" "}
      to collect on-chain data.

        I tried to create a project but the transaction didn’t go through, I got
        an error message similar to this:
      </strong>
    </h4>
    <br />
    <img

      alt="alt_text"
      title="image_tooltip"
    />
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      This error is caused when creating a project with an account different
      than the users NEAR Discovery account that is actively logged in: (e.g.
      janedoe.near is creating a project for janedoeproject.near)
    </p>
    <p>
      Your project has its own account. In order to add admins on a project,
      including yourself, you must log in with the project account id, and visit
      the link to grant appropriate permissions to yourself and your team. Once
      completed, log back in with your user account (the account you are using
      now) to complete the setup process.
