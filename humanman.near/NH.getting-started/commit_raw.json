This guide will help\n      you get started with NEAR Horizon, a Web3 platform for connecting startups\n      to contributors, services, resources, and financing.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <br />\n    <h2>Landing Page</h2>\n    <br />\n    <p>\n      Whether you've navigated to the NEAR Horizon landing page from a shared\n      link or found it through a BOS Gateway, you'll be greeted with a\n      personalized dashboard.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <br />\n    <img\n      alt=\"near horizon landing page\"\n      src=\"https://nearhorizonassets.s3.amazonaws.com/landing_basic_features_optimized.gif\"\n    />\n    <br />\n    <br />\n    <p>\n      Here you can create a new project, manage your existing projects, update\n      your profile, check your inbox, and more. These options are available in\n      the sidebar on the left.\n    </p>\n    <br />\n    <h2>Creating a Project</h2>\n    <br />\n    <p>\n      To create a new project, click the \"Create new\" button on the top right of\n      the page. A drop-down will appear. Select \"Project\". A form will appear.\n      Fill out the form with the details of your project.\n    </p>\n    <br />\n    <img\n      alt=\"creating a project on near horizon\"\n      src=\"https://nearhorizonassets.s3.amazonaws.com/create_project_optimized.gif\"\n    />\n    <br />\n    <br />\n    <p>\n      When you are ready, click the \"Create project\" button at the bottom of the\n      form. Or you can save the form and complete later by clicking the \"Save\n      for later\" button (also at the bottom of the form). Once created, you will\n      be navigated to the project page.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <br />\n    <p>\n      Take a moment to review your project details which are displayed in the\n      sidebar on the right. You can edit any of these details by clicking the\n      \"Edit\" button next to the detail you would like to change.\n    </p>\n    <br />\n    <p>\n      That's it! You've created your first project on NEAR Horizon.\n      Congratulations!\n    </p>\n    <br />\n    <br />\n    <h2>FAQ</h2>\n    <br />\n    <h3>Credits</h3>\n    <br />\n    <h4>\n      Is NHZN a fungible token which can be used throughout the NEAR Ecosystem?\n    </h4>\n    <br />\n    <p>\n      No, NHZN can only be used inside the NEAR Horizon product. Addresses which\n      are eligible to receive and transfer credits will be whitelisted and gated\n      to only NEAR Horizon accelerator teams and service partners.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <br />\n    <br />\n    <h4>Why not use a stable coin or $NEAR?</h4>\n    <br />\n    <p>\n      Stable coins or $NEAR can be used throughout the entire NEAR ecosystem and\n      even transferred to a different blockchain. The credit system for NEAR\n      Horizon must be used solely for services founding teams need to succeed.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <br />\n    <br />\n    <h4>What are the pros/cons of doing the same thing off-chain?</h4>\n    <br />\n    <p>\n      Tracking service credit usage on-chain is beneficial for the auditability\n      and transparency of a complex marketplace between service providers and\n      accelerator teams. Utilizing a smart contract and building the\n      functionality into the NEAR Horizon Product (built on BOS) to facilitate\n      the use of NEAR Horizon service credits reduces the operational complexity\n      and effort required. Creating an interface built on NEAR where both\n      service providers and founding teams can connect will spawn new ideas\n      about how different entities and contributors can interface on the BOS!\n    </p>\n  </div>\n);\n", "metadata": null, "branch": null, "widget_modules_used": null, "widget_url": "https://near.social/#/humanman.near/widget/NH.getting-started"}
