    what is near? NEAR Protocol is a decentralized blockchain platform designed
    to enable the creation and execution of decentralized applications (dApps).
    It aims to provide a scalable and secure infrastructure for developers to
    build and deploy decentralized applications on the blockchain. NEAR Protocol
    uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which allows for faster and
    more efficient transaction processing compared to other blockchain
    platforms. This is achieved through a unique sharding design, where
    transactions are processed in parallel across multiple shards. One of the
    key features of NEAR Protocol is its focus on developer experience, with a
    user-friendly development environment, built-in smart contract languages,
    and support for popular programming languages such as Rust and
    AssemblyScript. NEAR also offers a range of developer tools, including its
    own decentralized storage solution, which can be used to store and retrieve
    data in a secure and decentralized manner. Overall, NEAR Protocol aims to
    provide a blockchain platform that is accessible and user-friendly for
    developers, while also offering a highly scalable and secure infrastructure
    for the creation and execution of decentralized applications.
