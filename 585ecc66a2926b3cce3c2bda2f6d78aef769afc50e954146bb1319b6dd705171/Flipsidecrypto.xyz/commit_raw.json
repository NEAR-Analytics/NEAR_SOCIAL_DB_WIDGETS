NEAR Protocol is a decentralized blockchain platform designed\r\n    to enable the creation and execution of decentralized applications (dApps).\r\n    It aims to provide a scalable and secure infrastructure for developers to\r\n    build and deploy decentralized applications on the blockchain. NEAR Protocol\r\n    uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which allows for faster and\r\n    more efficient transaction processing compared to other blockchain\r\n    platforms. This is achieved through a unique sharding design, where\r\n    transactions are processed in parallel across multiple shards. One of the\r\n    key features of NEAR Protocol is its focus on developer experience, with a\r\n    user-friendly development environment, built-in smart contract languages,\r\n    and support for popular programming languages such as Rust and\r\n    AssemblyScript. NEAR also offers a range of developer tools, including its\r\n    own decentralized storage solution, which can be used to store and retrieve\r\n    data in a secure and decentralized manner. Overall, NEAR Protocol aims to\r\n    provide a blockchain platform that is accessible and user-friendly for\r\n    developers, while also offering a highly scalable and secure infrastructure\r\n    for the creation and execution of decentralized applications.\r\n  </div>\r\n);\r\n", "metadata": null, "branch": null, "widget_modules_used": null, "widget_url": "https://near.social/#/585ecc66a2926b3cce3c2bda2f6d78aef769afc50e954146bb1319b6dd705171/widget/Flipsidecrypto.xyz"}
