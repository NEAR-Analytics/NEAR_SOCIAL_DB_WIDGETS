            Considering AstroDAO is being deprecated, we are building out all
            functionality of DAO's on NEAR. With this tools, anyone can submit a
            proposal to add a member to a DAO. We will be adding this to the
            profile page with a drop down so you can invite new members to join
            specific DAOs and subgroup as our tooling evolves. Aka FRIEND into
            DAO.

            We allow users to directly send support / trusted ERC-20 tokens on

            This is still a work in progress, but meant to be a Polygon NFT

            added multichain support and multiple contracts (pulling from

            dependency support, we became the first BOS Directory on BOS. In the
