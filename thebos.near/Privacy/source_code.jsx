This Privacy Policy describes the types of information gathered by Proximity Labs Limited (BVI) (" **Proximity**", "us" or "we") in the process of providing http://bos.gg/ (the "Site"), how we use the information, with whom the information may be shared, what choices are available to you, and our efforts to protect the information you provide to us through the Site.

By using the Site, you agree to allow us to process information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

This policy is subject to change. If our information retention or usage practices change, we will let you know by posting the Privacy Policy changes on the Site. Your continued use of the Service following our notice of changes to this Privacy Policy, or other method of legal acceptance, means you accept such changes. Please refer to the "Effective Date" above to see when this Policy was last updated.

**Territoriality**

This Privacy Policy may be subject to the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("EU GDPR"), the UK General Data Protection Regulation ("UK-GDPR", and together with the EU GDPR, the "GDPR"), and other applicable privacy laws. Under the GDPR, Proximity is a data Controller. If you are an individual located in the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, the European Economic Area, or Switzerland (collectively, and for the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the "EEA"), you are a Data Subject with certain protected privacy rights concerning your Personal Data. We will take commercially reasonable steps to maintain compliance with GDPR. Your Personal Data may identify you as a person, and thus may be referred to in this Privacy Policy as Personally Identifiable Information ("PII").

1. **Who Collects Your Information On Our Service?**

Under the GDPR, Proximity is what is known as a "Controller" of the Personal Data that you provide us with. We collect information from you on the Site, and we are responsible for protection of your information.

1. **What Information Does Proximity Collect?**

Like most websites delivered via the Internet, we may collect non-personally identifiable or anonymous information about you that is stored in technical log files. This information may include, but is not limited to, IP addresses, traffic routing data, system configuration information, and other information about traffic to our website.

Automatically tracking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses is one method of automatically collecting information about your activities online and information volunteered by you. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your device whenever you surf the internet.

1. **Why Is My Information Being Collected?**

We may accept and gather information to provide the Site to you. If you contact us, we collect your personal information so that we can respond to your requests for information. We may collect log information to help us to diagnose problems with our servers, administer the Site, calculate usage levels, and otherwise provide services to you.

1. **How Do We Use the Information We Collect?**

We may use anonymous information that we collect to enable you to access and use the Site. We may use any anonymous, aggregate information without restriction.

1. **Do We Share Your Personal Information?**

We may make available personal data or aggregate information to our affiliates and related entities, agents, representatives, service providers and contractors for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Any information shared with such service providers is subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. All service providers that we engage with are restricted to only utilizing the information according to our instructions. We work with persons or organizations with whom we contract to carry out internal operations or business activities, which includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, and spam and malware prevention.

1. **What Are Your Rights Regarding Your Personal Information?**

You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether personal data concerning you is being processed, and, where that is the case, access the personal data and all the relevant information. For any questions about the process, you may send an email to legal@proximity.dev.

1. **How Do We Retain and Protect Your Information?**

We will hold your personal data only for as long as it is necessary for us to do so, having regard to the purposes described in this Policy and our own legal and regulatory requirements. We usually do not retain any data concerning users. From time to time, in order to perform analysis concerning the use of our Site and ameliorate its settings we will retain personal data for a maximum period of 90 days. The retained data will be immediately erased at the end of our analysis.

- The right to restrict processing. This is the right to ask for a temporary halt to processing of your personal data, such as in the case where a dispute or legal case has to be concluded, or the data is being corrected.
- The right to data portability. This is the right to ask for your personal data to be provided to you in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.
- The right to object. This is the right to object to further processing your personal data if such processing is inconsistent with the primary purposes for which it was collected.
- Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling. This is the right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing. The Site does not engage in automated decision making and profiling.
