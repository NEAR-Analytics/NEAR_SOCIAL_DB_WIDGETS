This Terms of Use Agreement (the "Terms" or "Agreement") explains the terms and conditions by which you may access and use the Site. Please read this Agreement carefully. This Agreement applies to you ("You") as a user of the Site. _ **This Agreement contains a mandatory individual arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver provision that requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions.** _

To use the Site, you must be able to form a legally binding contract online either as an individual or on behalf of a legal entity. To that end, you represent that, if you are agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of a legal entity, you have the legal authority to bind the company or other legal entity to this Agreement and you are at least 18 years old or the age of majority where you reside, whichever is older, can form a legally binding contract online, and have the full, right, power, and authority to enter into and to comply with the obligations under this Agreement.

You are advised to check this Agreement periodically to familiarize yourself with any changes to the terms. We, in our sole discretion, reserve the right to make changes to our terms of use. Changes are binding on users of the Site and will take effect immediately upon posting. As a user, you agree to be bound by any changes, variations, or modifications to our terms of use and your continued use of the Site shall constitute acceptance of any such changes, variations, or modifications.

By accessing or using the Site, you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety. _If you do not agree, you are not authorized to access or use the Site._

1. Site

The Site provides information about and a set of tools for users to locally run or view code that may be relevant to blockchain based protocols built on L1 and L2 blockchains like Ethereum, NEAR, and Canto. In particular, the Site contains a specially designed virtual machine capable of locally loading and running "front end" components ("Components") for blockchain based application layer protocols on any L1 or L2 blockchain. The code for these Components can be viewed via the Site, similar to viewing a smart contract in Etherscan.

You acknowledge and agree that the Components are stored entirely on the NEAR blockchain protocol and Proximity has no control over any blockchain, protocol, smart contract, or blockchain-based applications. Any interaction with a Component is a locally run instance by the user and not known to or otherwise under the control of Proximity.

2. Access

Access to the Site is provided "as is" and on an "as available" basis only. We do not guarantee that the Site, or any content on it, will always be available or uninterrupted. From time to time, access may be interrupted, suspended, or restricted, including because of a fault, error, unforeseen circumstances, or because we are carrying out planned maintenance.

We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Site to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction we so desire and/or to terminate your access to and use of the site, at any time and in our sole discretion.

We may remove or amend the content of the Site at any time. However, some of the content may be out of date at any given time and we are under no obligation to update it. We do not guarantee that the Site, or any content on it, will be free from errors or omissions.

We will not be liable to you for any loss or damage you may suffer as a result of the Site being unavailable at any time for any reason.

You are solely responsible for your use of the Site. You acknowledge and understand that the Site merely provides information and a set of tools to locally run or view fully onchain Components. To the extent you locally run any Component that results in interaction with a blockchain-based protocol requiring the use of a blockchain account, you agree to take appropriate action to secure, protect and backup your accounts in a manner that will provide appropriate security and protection, which might include use of encryption. This includes your obligation under this Agreement to record and securely maintain any passwords or backup security phrases (i.e. "seed" phrases) that relate to your use of any blockchain. You acknowledge that you will not share with us nor any other third party any password or backup/seed phrase that relates to your use of the Site, and that we will not be held responsible if you do share any such phrase or password.

There are no fees or charges for use of the Site. Use of blockchain protocol networks are typically subject to third-party transaction fees. Any interaction with a blockchain protocol network is a locally run instance and, as a result, Proximity has no knowledge of such interactions, does not receive such fees, and has no ability to reverse or refund any amounts paid in error to initiate any transaction.

3. Eligibility

To access or use the Site, you must be able to form a legally binding contract with us. Accordingly, you represent that you are at least eighteen years old and have the full right, power, and authority to enter into and comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement on behalf of yourself and any company or legal entity for which you may access or use the Site. You further represent that you are not a citizen, resident, or member of any jurisdiction or group that is subject to economic sanctions, or where your use of the Site would be illegal or otherwise violate any applicable law. You further represent that your access and use of the Site will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and that you will not access or use the Site to conduct, promote, or otherwise facilitate any illegal activity.

4. Modification of this Agreement

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify this Agreement from time to time. If we make any modifications, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of the Agreement and by maintaining a current version of the Agreement at [link]. All modifications will be effective when they are posted, and your continued use of the Site will serve as confirmation of your acceptance of those modifications. If you do not agree with any modifications to this Agreement, you must immediately stop accessing and using the Site.

You further agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe you are those set out expressly in this Agreement.

12. Assumption of Risk

By accessing and using the Site, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of digital assets.

You acknowledge and agree that there is significant risk and uncertainty regarding the operation and effects and risks of utilizing novel, experimental, speculative, and experimental cryptographic technologies and blockchain technologies, including tokens, cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, "smart contracts," consensus algorithms, voting systems and distributed, decentralized or peer-to-peer networks or systems in connection with the Site or otherwise.

You further understand that the markets for digital assets are highly volatile due to factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You acknowledge that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems are variable and may increase dramatically at any time.

You further acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks, do not own or control the Ethereum blockchain, NEAR protocol, or any other blockchain system and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using the Site.

To the extent you locally run a Component related to digital assets, we make no warranties as to the markets on which digital assets are transferred, purchased, or traded. You acknowledge and understand that the Site does not facilitate such activity and that any activity is a locally run instance that is not known to or under the control of Proximity. You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to any digital asset transactions that you enter with a locally run instance. We are not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions.

We do not store, send, or receive digital assets or funds. This is because digital assets exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on its supporting blockchain. Any transfer of digital assets occurs within decentralized smart contracts and blockchains and not in or otherwise via the Site. We cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify any transaction or transaction details. There are no warranties or guarantees that a transfer initiated via a locally run Component will successfully transfer title or right in any digital asset.

Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the Site and locally running any Component to interact with any blockchain-based protocol.

The Site provides information regarding and a set of tools for locally interacting with emerging technologies, such as Ethereum and NEAR. Your decision to locally run any Component or instance to interact with blockchain protocols is subject to increased risk through your potential misuse of things such as public/private key cryptography, or failing to properly update or run software to accommodate protocol upgrades. By using the Site you explicitly acknowledge and accept these heightened risks.

You represent that you are financially and technically sophisticated enough to understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems and upgrading your software and processes to accommodate protocol upgrades, and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of digital assets such as Ether (ETH), Near, and other digital tokens.

In particular, you understand that these are locally run instances, that we do not operate or control the Ethereum blockchain protocol, NEAR blockchain protocol, or any other blockchain protocol, communicate or execute protocol upgrades, or approve or process blockchain transactions on behalf of you.

You further understand that blockchain protocols present their own risks of use, that supporting or participating in the protocol may result in losses if your participation violates certain protocol rules, that blockchain-based transactions are irreversible, that your private key and backup seed phrase must be kept secret at all times, that Proximity will not store a backup of, nor will be able to discover or recover, your private key or backup seed phrase, and that you are solely responsible for any approvals or permissions you provide by cryptographically signing blockchain messages or transactions.

You further understand and accept that digital tokens present market volatility risk, technical software risks, regulatory risks, and cybersecurity risks. You understand that the cost and speed of a blockchain-based system is variable, that cost may increase dramatically at any time, and that cost and speed is not within the capability of Proximity to control. You understand that protocol upgrades may inadvertently contain bugs or security vulnerabilities that may result in loss of functionality and ultimately funds.

You understand and accept that Proximity does not control any blockchain protocol, nor does Proximity control any smart contract that is not otherwise offered by Proximity.

You agree that you alone, and not Proximity, is responsible for any transactions that you engage in with regard to supporting any blockchain protocol whether through transaction validation or otherwise, or any transactions that you engage in with any third-party-developed smart contract or token, including tokens that were created by a third party for the purpose of fraudulently misrepresenting affiliation with any blockchain project.

You agree that Proximity is not responsible for the regulatory status or treatment of any digital assets that you may access or transact with using a locally run Component. You expressly assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the offerings to interact with blockchain protocols.

13. Release of Claims

You expressly agree that you assume all risks in connection with your access and use of the Site and your interaction with the Protocol. You further expressly waive and release us from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way relating to your use of the Site and your interaction with the Protocol. If you are a California resident, you waive the benefits and protections of California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: "[a] general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party."

14. Indemnity

You agree to hold harmless, release, defend, and indemnify us and our officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, and subsidiaries from and against all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses arising from: (a) your access and use of the Site; (b) your violation of any term or condition of this Agreement, the right of any third party, or any other applicable law, rule, or regulation; and (c) any other party's access and use of the Site with your assistance or using any device or account that you own or control.

We assume no liability or responsibility for any: (a) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content; (b) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from any access or use of the Site; (c) unauthorized access or use of any secure server or database in our control, or the use of any information or data stored therein; (d) interruption or cessation of function related to the Site; (e) bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through the Site; (f) errors or omissions in, or loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of, any content made available through the Site; and (g) the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party. Under no circumstances shall we or any of our officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries be liable to you for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses, or costs in an amount exceeding the amount you paid to us in exchange for access to and use of the Site, or $100.00, whichever is greater. This limitation of liability applies regardless of whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, and even if we have been advised of the possibility of such liability. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of certain liabilities and damages. Accordingly, some of the disclaimers and limitations set forth in this Agreement may not apply to you. This limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law.
